$McDescription=@'
Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful
features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell
and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most
sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.
