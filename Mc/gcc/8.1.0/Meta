$McTitle='GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection'
$McDescription=@'
The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, as
well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++,...). GCC was originally written as the compiler
for the GNU operating system. The GNU system was developed to be 100% free software, free in the
sense that it respects the user's freedom.
