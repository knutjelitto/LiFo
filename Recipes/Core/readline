    # Reinstalling Readline will cause the old libraries to be moved to <libraryname>.old.
    # While this is normally not a problem, in some cases it can trigger a linking bug in ldconfig.#
    # This can be avoided by issuing the following two seds:
    sed -i '/MV.*old/d' Makefile.in
    sed -i '/{OLDSUFF}/c:' support/shlib-install

    ./configure \
        --prefix=/usr       \
        --disable-static

    make
    make install

    install -v -m644 doc/*.{ps,pdf,html,dvi} /usr/share/doc/readline
