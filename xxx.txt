I need some SQL Server Database restore on a Virtual Server running in the DMZ.

Server: DE01WSVRCL01
SQLServer Instance: VeriCalUS
Databases: Juno / JunoTest / JunoTraining

The Backups should be from before 12.06.2018 11:28:28 (so a nightly from 12.06. or before seems to be ok)

Plesed triple-check its the right SQLServer instance (VeriCalUS)

Last time such an incident was handled by Felix Zantner (see ticket 243258)

Thx
